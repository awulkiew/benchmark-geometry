# Boost.Geometry benchmarks

Benchmarks for [Boost.Geometry library](http://github.com/boostorg/geometry).

### Results

Results can be found on this [github.io page](https://awulkiew.github.io/benchmark-geometry).

### How does it work?

* sha of Boost.Geometry commit is pushed into the [benchmark-geometry-trigger](https://github.com/awulkiew/benchmark-geometry-trigger)
* [benchmark-geometry-trigger](https://github.com/awulkiew/benchmark-geometry-trigger) build starts at [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/awulkiew/benchmark-geometry-trigger)
* benchmarks and report generator are pulled from [master branch](https://github.com/awulkiew/benchmark-geometry/tree/master) and archived results are pulled from [results branch](https://github.com/awulkiew/benchmark-geometry/tree/results)
* benchmarks are built and run and new results are gathered
* new results are merged with older results and output data.json file is generated by report generator
* merged results are pushed back into [results branch](https://github.com/awulkiew/benchmark-geometry/tree/results) and data.json file is pushed into [gh-pages branch](https://github.com/awulkiew/benchmark-geometry/tree/gh-pages)
* data.json file is used by index.html at [github.io page](https://awulkiew.github.io/benchmark-geometry)
